This project is **ROBOSOC** based Group Project which is the University of Manchester Robotic Society.

Our Group title is **SixSenses** as we have **six different types of sensors**.

We will use the Raspberry Pi pico W microcontroller.

## About this Project
This project is ROBOSOC based Group Project which is the University of Manchester Robotic Society.

Our Group title is SixSenses as we aims to use six different types of sensors.

This robot will be used to geather the data and analyse them where human would hesistate to be.

We will use the Raspberry Pi pico W microcontroller and code with micropython.

However, C are used in some case for the basic components settings.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>## Micropython
>**Micropython** has exactly same features as python. Just consider it as python which can interact with the hardware components.
>
>Before micropython starts, **micropython firmware** for the raspberry pi pico W must be uploaded to the board first so that it can read the code.
>
>More information can be found easily on the internet and **I have uploaded the firmwware for Raspberry Pi pico W** on the code page so please feel free to use.
>For other types of microcontroller, you should find the corresponding microcontroller and upload it.
